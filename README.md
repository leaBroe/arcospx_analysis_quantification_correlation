# Detection of Actin Polymerization Waves and Cross-Correlation with Myosin and rGBD Channels using ARCOS

This project was carried out as part of a research project at the Pertz Lab at the Institute of Cell Biology at the University of Bern. The aim was to use the ARCOS algorithm (https://github.com/bgraedel/arcos4py.git) to detect actin polymerisation waves, quantify them and calculate the cross correlation to myosin and rGBD channels.

For the tracking and quantification part, please see the file [arcospx_analysis_tracking_quantification_complete.ipynb](https://github.com/leaBroe/arcospx_analysis_quantification_correlation/blob/master/arcospx_analysis_tracking_quantification_complete.ipynb)
