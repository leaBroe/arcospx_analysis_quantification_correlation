# Detection of Actin Polymerization Waves and Cross-Correlation with Myosin and rGBD Channels in Rat Embryonic Fibroblasts using ARCOS

## Overview
This research project was done at the Pertz Lab, Institute of Cell Biology at the University of Bern. The aim of the project was to use the ARCOS algorithm (https://github.com/bgraedel/arcos4py.git) to detect actin polymerization waves, quantify them and calculate the cross correlation to myosin and rGBD channels. Another goal of the project was the development and application of ARCOSpx, an extension of the ARCOS algorithm, designed for the tracking and analysis of cellular events, that can convert images directly into tracked collective events. The focus lay on examining the dynamics between actin waves, myosin, and rGBD channels, thereby unveiling the regulatory mechanisms of RhoA in these processes.  

## Objectives
- **Development of ARCOSpx Plugin**: Enhancing the ARCOS algorithm to convert images directly into tracked collective events.  
- **Understanding Actin Dynamics**: Investigating the patterns, directionality, and regulation of actin polymerization waves in REF52 cells.  
- **Elucidating RhoA's Role**: Exploring how RhoA functions as a negative regulator in the assembly and disassembly of these waves.  

## Methodology  
### Data Collection and Preprocessing
Rat embryonic ﬁbroblasts (REF52) were treated with Platelet Derived Growth Factor (PDGF) 24 hours before real-time microscopic imaging. To mitigate the eﬀects of photobleaching during microscopy imaging, we employed a histogram matching technique. This method aligns the intensity distribution of a source image (imaging data frame by frame) to that of a template image (ﬁrst frame), which is less aﬀected by photobleaching. The method involved calculating histograms for both sets of images, generating cumulative distribution functions, and creating a lookup table to map source image intensities to those of the template. The output was an adjusted source image with an intensity distribution closely resembling that of the template, eﬀectively mitigating photobleaching eﬀects. In order to make the tracking more faster afterwards, we then binned the time series images using a median ﬁlter and subsequently removed the background using arcos4py (version 0.2.3).  
### Segmentation of Fibroblast Cells and Tracking of Actin Polymerization Events
In order to avoid that the partially high signals around the edges of the cells would be falsely detected as polymerisation waves, we segmented the cells in order to calculate a distance map. The segmentation was carried out using the python package cellpose (version 2.2.3). The tracking of the actin polymerization events was done by the track events function of arcos4py.
### Quantification of Actin Polymerization Waves
The result of the event tracking process was a labeled image, where different objects in the image are marked with unique integer labels. These labels are then analyzed using the regionprops function from the skimage.measure Python package. This function calculates various properties for each labeled region, including area (pixel count), centroid (center of mass), label (unique identifier), and intensity mean (average pixel intensity). Additionally, for each uniquely identified object in the dataset, data is isolated and sorted by frame number. The x and y coordinates of the object's start and end points, along with the corresponding frame numbers, are recorded. This information is used to determine the object's lifetime (duration across frames), average size (mean area), and average velocity (calculated from position changes over time).
### Calculation of Start and End Points of the Tracked Polymerization Waves 
Each wave, identified by a unique ID, had its start and end points (x and y coordinates) determined and visualized on the initial frame of an actin imaging time series. All the start and end points of the waves were plotted together, despite occurring at different times. A distance transform was applied to the segmented cellular structures, creating a matrix with values increasing from the cell periphery to the center. This gradation allowed for quantitative analysis of each point's spatial position within the cell, with higher values indicating points further from the cell edge and lower values indicating proximity to the edge. For each wave, the distance map values at the start and end points were calculated to determine the direction of the wave's movement. For instance, a wave starting near the cell edge (value 1) and moving towards the center (value 5) would have a difference of -4, indicating inward movement. The differences between start and end points for all waves were statistically analyzed using a Wilcoxon-signed rank test, suitable for non-normally distributed and paired data. Additionally, the magnitude of the distance between these points was correlated with their respective distances to the cell border. This approach provided a detailed understanding of the directionality and dynamics of polymerization waves within the cellular structure.
### Velocity Calculation of Polymerization Waves 
Due to the tendency of polymerization waves to split into different directions, using centroids as start and end points for speed calculation is not effective. Instead, each wave, identified by a unique ID and its splitting subevents, are individually labeled. The centroids of these smaller events are calculated, and their velocities are determined. The average velocity of these subevents is then used to represent the overall velocity of each tracked wave.

### Cross-Correlation Analysis
The intensity values for each channel was extracted for a single event and plotted over time. For this, we set a middle frame where the event is fully visible and extract the intensity values for the event in a range of 50 frames before and after the middle frame. The intensity values are then plotted over time. We then did this for all frames where the specific events took place. So we took e.g. frame 193 as the middle frame, because ID 60 was most pronounced there. Then we went backwards and forwards 50 frames, starting from frame 193, and for each channel we extracted and plotted the intensity values for the fixed range from the specific ID of frame 193. We repeated this for middle frames ranging from 180 to 246 (this was the range at which the specific tracked polymerization wave was present). From these 66 frames we took the average and repeated for the other 2 channels. For the further cross-correlation, we normalized the intensities. The cross-correlation was done using the scipy package for python (version 1.11.4).

## Findings  
- **Actin Wave Characteristics**: Identified specific patterns in the movement of actin waves, predominantly towards the cell center.  
- **RhoA's Regulatory Function**: Teh results support RhoA's role as a negative regulator, influencing the disassembly phases of actin polymerization waves.  
- **Spatiotemporal Correlations**: Established correlations between the actin waves and myosin and rGBD channels, indicating potential regulatory mechanisms.  

## Conclusion and Future Work
This project aimed to contribute to the broader understanding of actin polymerization dynamics in cellular signaling. It sought to highlight the potential complexities in the regulatory roles of proteins like RhoA within these processes.
